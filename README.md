# Movie Search ðŸŽ¬ 

Moved - A Movie and TV searching App 

Check it out here - https://rachel-beale.github.io/project-2/ 

## Overview

For my second General Assembly project we paired up  for a 48 hour hackathon to create a multi-page app using an external API of our choosing. 

## Brief 
* **Consume a public API** â€“ this could be anything but it must make sense for the project.
* **The app should include a router** - with several "pages".
* **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.
* Have **semantically clean HTML** - to write HTML that makes structural sense rather than thinking about how it might look, which is the job of CSS.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.

## Technologies Used
 - React.js
 - SCSS
 - GitHub
 - Babel
 - Webpack
 - Bulma
 - Insomnia
 - OMDB API

## Approach Taken 
### Planning

We quickly agreed to create an app that would search for films and TV programmes, not only by name but by type and year. We wanted each film or programme card to be a link to another page that contained more detailed information on the selected item.
We then talked through how we would achieve this, whitboarding out the basic structure of the app as well as the functions and components that would be needed.


### Method 
After creating the basic React structure of our app, the main focus was to get the key component of the project working - the search function. 

**The search function**

1. OMDB searchs for films by key word; using our input component we were able to extract the input value from the search bar which we placed into the variable `{searched}`
  This variable was then used to create our basic URL to fetch data from the OMDB API.  

  ```javascript
  <input className="input is-family-code searchi"
                    placeholder="Search"
                    onChange={(event) => updateSearch(event.target.value)}
                    value={search} />
                </div>
                <div className="control">
                  <button className="button is-family-code is-dark"
                    onClick={() => {
                      updateSearched(search)
                    }}>
                    Search
                  </button>
  ```

2. We wanted to add a varity of filters onto our search function which we did using radio buttons to filter for movies, series or all as well as another input to filter by year. 
3. To filter the search as per the users request, we needed to implement an `if-else` statement to ensure that the correct function ran, no matter which filters were being used. 
4. The `useEffect` react hook was used to make sure the fetch happened only when needed - such as when a new filter or search was created.  

```javascript
const searchFunction = (searched, category, year, page) => {
    const plainUrl = `https://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=${process.env.API_KEY}&s=${searched}&page=${page}`
    const urlCategory = `${plainUrl}&type=${category}`
    const urlYear = `${plainUrl}&y=${year}`
    const urlLong = `${urlCategory}&y=${year}`
    let url = ''

    if (year && !category) {
      url = urlYear
    } else if (category && !year) {
      url = urlCategory
    } else if (year && category) {
      url = urlLong
    } else {
      url = plainUrl
    }
    if (searched) {
      axios.get(url)
        .then(resp => {
          updateDisplaySearch(resp.data.Search || [])
          updateError(resp.data.Error || '')
          updateNumResults(resp.data.totalResults)
        })
    }
  }
```

Working example of the search function:

**Linking the pages**
We used react-router to link pages throughout our app - including the invididual movie page from the search

```javascript
<Link key={index} to={`/project-2/search/${movie.imdbID}`}>
```

**Single Movie Page**

We used `props` to pull through the movie ID needed that would render the specific information for that film/programme onto the single movie page. 

```javascript
const Movie = (props) => {
  const movieId = props.match.params.movieId
  const [movie, updateMovie] = useState([])
  { console.log(movieId) }

  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get(`https://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=a48a3d11&i=${movieId}`)
      .then(resp => {
        updateMovie(resp.data)
      })
  }, [])
```

### Challenges 

**Pagination**
One of the most challenging aspects of our project was getting the pagination component to work correctly. 

The API limited us to only 10 results per page so we needed  pagination to ensure that the user could have access to all the results for their search.

```javascript
  const [page, updatePage] = useState(1)
  const POSTS_PER_PAGE = 10

  // For the pagination once the API results load. 
  const Pager = ({ currentPage }) => {
    const pages = Math.ceil(numResults / POSTS_PER_PAGE)
    return (
      <Pagination
        pages={pages}
        currentPage={currentPage}
        onChange={page => updatePage(page)}
      />
    )
  }
```

After refactoring our plain URL to include the page number, we were able to implement the pagination to track the current page and to update the search results depending on the page number button clicked.

To make this component work within the boundaries of this API was a challenge, however with a little persistance we managed to get it working well.

# Future enhancements.
 - This project would benefit from a moving carousel on the home or search page which could display featured movies that the user could explore.
 - To utilize local storage that would allow the user to create wish lists of movies & programmes they would like to watch.
 - To intergrate other APIs so that more information could be provided - such as details on actors, links to external pages to watch the movie such as netflix etc. 
 - To make the app more mobile friendly 

## Summary

Over the course of this hackathon, we became more comfortable with a variety of technical skills such as using APIs and pagination. Additionally, we solidified the knowledge to transfer information between components and make `fetch` requests to specific URLs by utilising `template literals`. 

Lessons Learned:
  - efficient ways to pair-programming
  - meeting strict deadlines 
  - develop a presentation skills through the demo proccess
